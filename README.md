# Android-Anagram

# Creating an Android app for a simple Anagram game.

# Anagram
* An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. 
* For example, cinema is an anagram of iceman.

# Mechanics of the game
* The game provides the user with a word from the dictionary.
* The user tries to create as many words as possible that contain all the letters of the given word plus one additional letter. 
* Note that adding the extra letter at the beginning or the end without reordering the other letters is not valid. 
* For example, if the game picks the word 'ore' as a starter, the user might guess 'rose' or 'zero' but not 'sore'.
* The user can give up and see the words that they did not guess

# In order to ensure that the game is not too difficult, the computer will only propose words that have at least 5 possible valid anagrams.
